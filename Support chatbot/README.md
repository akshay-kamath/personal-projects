# Support Chatbot

Welcome to the **Support Chatbot** project! This tool is designed to assist users by integrating advanced AI capabilities to interact with website data and provide relevant information. Utilizing Hugging Face for language models and Pinecone for vector search, this chatbot enables intelligent, context-aware support.

## Project Structure

- **app.py**: The main Streamlit application script. Handles user inputs, manages API keys, and interacts with Pinecone and Hugging Face.
- **utils.py**: Contains utility functions for data fetching, processing, and interaction with Pinecone.
- **constants.py**: Stores configuration constants such as website URL and Pinecone settings.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists all required Python packages.
- **README.md**: This documentation file.

## Features

- **Data Integration**: Fetch data from a website sitemap and process it.
- **Chunking**: Splits data into manageable chunks for better search results.
- **Embeddings**: Creates embeddings for documents using Sentence Transformers.
- **Pinecone Integration**: Pushes and pulls data to/from Pinecone vector store.
- **Search Functionality**: Allows users to search for relevant documents based on queries.
